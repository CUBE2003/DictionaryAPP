# Dictionary App in Kotlin with MVVM Architecture

This is a Dictionary app built in Kotlin that allows users to search for the definition of a word using a free API. The app is developed following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the concerns of data, UI, and business logic. It also leverages several modern Android development libraries for smooth functioning.

## Features

- Search for the definition of a word.
- Clean and intuitive user interface built with Jetpack Compose.
- Proper error handling using NetworkResponse library.
- Dependency injection with Dagger Hilt.
- Asynchronous operations handled using Kotlin Flows.
- MVVM architecture with ViewModel for managing UI-related data and states.

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin
- Dagger Hilt
- Retrofit
- OkHttp
- Jetpack Compose
- NetworkResponse
